            highest individual score in a One Day International (ODI) match, scoring 264 runs against Sri Lanka in 2014.

            earned him a special place in the hearts of cricket fans around the world.</p>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra.[4] His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from
                Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.[5] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm
                storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low
                income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during
                weekends.[6] He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[7]

                Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp, asked
                him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and the
                cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma’s old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him I
                couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did well in
                my cricket".[7] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his batting
                ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris and Giles
                Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener</p>

            <h2>Youth and domestic first class carrier</h2>
            <p>Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in March
                2005. Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3 wickets with 24 balls
                remaining. Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja made their debuts in the same match.[9] It was Sharma's
                unbeaten innings of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College Ground in
                Udaipur in the same tournament that brought him into the limelight.[10] He visited Abu Dhabi and
                Australia with the India A squad and was then included among India's 30-member probables list for the
                upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament, although he did not make the final squad.[11]

                Sharma made his first-class debut for India A against New Zealand A at Darwin in July 2006. He scored 57
                and 22 as India won by 3 wickets.[12] He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the 2006–07 season
                and scored 205 off 267 balls against Gujarat.[13] Mumbai went on to win the tournament with Sharma
                scoring a half-century (57) in his second innings in the final against Bengal.[14]

                Sharma has spent his entire domestic first-class career at Mumbai. In December 2009, he made his highest
                career score of 309 not out in the Ranji Trophy against Gujarat.[15] In October 2013, upon the
                retirement of Ajit Agarkar, he was appointed team captain ahead of the 2013–14 season.</p>

            <h2>Playing Style</h2>
            <p>Sharma is an aggressive batsman but plays with style and elegance.[88][89] He is usually an opening
                batsman in limited overs cricket, but has played most of his Test cricket as a middle-order
                batsman.[90][91] In limited overs cricket, Sharma is widely recognised as one of the format's most
                outstanding batsmen.[92][93] And for his attacking batting and six hitting abilities he often referred
                as Hitman.[94]

                Sunil Gavaskar considers Sharma to have a batting style similar to those of Virender Sehwag and Viv
                Richards. In his column for The Times of India in November 2018, Gavaskar said:[95]

                The standout performer in both the limited overs series and the T20 series has been Rohit Sharma. Like
                Virender Sehwag before him, he is unstoppable once he gets going and like Viru he has an appetite for
                big hundreds. When Viru used to get out looking to hit another delivery out of the park, there used to
                be consternation around the ground, just like it is when Rohit gets out to a seemingly casual shot. If
                Rohit can turn his white ball exploits into red ball cricket, he will be the most destructive batsman in
                the world after Viv Richards and Virender Sehwag.

                While Sharma is not a regular bowler, he can bowl right arm off spin.[4] He usually fields in the slips
                and has said this is a part of his game which he works very hard on for improvement.</p>

            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>Sharma holds the world record for the highest individual score by a batsman playing in a one-day
                international match, having scored 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on 13 November
                2014.[4] He is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in this form of international
                cricket.[97] In January 2020, Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International
                Cricket Council (ICC).[98] During the 2019 World Cup, Sharma became the only batsman to scored five
                centuries in a single edition of the Cricket World Cup.[99]

                On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score
                two centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman.[100] In the same series, he
                broke Shimron Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series</p>
